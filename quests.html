	<li>Remember any difficulties you run into while attempting a quest! We will be sharing difficulties we run into and give each other feedback during our regular meetings.</li>
	<li>Those that cannot make regular meetings can still get feedback over email or on Facebook.</li>
	<li>XP is only awarded after you have received feedback!</li>
	<li>There will be rewards for acquiring XP :D</li>

	<b>You can do these up to 4 times for XP:</b>
	<br><br>
	10 XP - Warm-up (Use a sheet of paper turned on its side)<br>
	Straight lines: Draw 10 horizontal lines in one stroke across the entire sheet. These will be boundaries for the next parts.<br>
	Circles: Draw 10 circles in one stroke. Use the lines as top and bottom boundaries.<br>
	Ellipses: Draw 10 ellipses in one stroke. Use the next row of lines as top and bottom boundaries.<br>
	Shading: Pick 1 or more points on a circle. Using it as a light source, shade the circle to suggest a sphere. Repeat 4 more times. Try different shading techniques, don't forget about reflections and ambient occlusion.<br>
	Focus: pencil control, understanding volume<br>
<br>
	15 XP - 10 gesture drawings, 30 seconds each. Start with 1 line of action. add lines that play off of it. Straight vs. curves.<br>
	Focus: depict the 'essence' of a pose quickly using few lines.<br>
	<br>
	<b>You can do these twice for XP:</b><br><br>
	25 XP - Observation<br>
	Choose a subject. Use a pencil to draw the subject as accurately as possible. Must be shaded.<br>
	Focus: realism, drawing what you see<br>
<br>	 
	25 XP - Volume Control<br>
	Choose a subject. Set up an animation workstation as shown in meetings or work digitally. Animate the subject being rotated 360 degrees. Keys will be front, left, back, right. Also do the in-betweens.<br>
	Focus: proportional consistency, develop sense for 3D motion.<br>
<br>
	Bonus 25 XP - Animate the subject spinning around 360 degrees. Depict personality and any extra trailing elements such as hair, clothing, etc as needed. Keys and breakdowns will be different, for an interesting motion, timing and spacing should not be kept constant! Recommend animating the main volumes first, then animate secondary trailing elements such as hair or clothing.<br>
	Focus: timing, spacing, gesture drawing, volume control, putting principles of animation together.<br>
	 <br>
	25 XP - Motion<br>
	Record yourself, a family member, or a friend. Using the footage as reference, draw the keys and breakdowns. Pursue accuracy. Keys are the 'what', breakdowns are the 'how'. Keys can be the extreme points of a motion while breakdowns can be the middle parts.<br>
	Focus: gesture drawing, break down motion, develop sense for which poses are most important to portray an action, develop sense for timing.<br>
	 <br>
	50 XP - Character Sheet<br>
	Design a character intended for animation. Need front view, back view, at least 6 emotion thumbnails and notes about behavioral quirks or drawing style. Must be fully developed enough that someone who has never seen your character before will be able to reproduce it using your notes.<br>
	 <br>
	50 XP - Animation<br>
	Starting from this pose, draw five or six pictures that end with him hitting the stake. Please draw the character without changing his size.<br>
	<br>
	<center><img src="Images/Resources/Quests/animationex.jpg"></center>
<br>
	Copy this drawing to whichever medium you're using and use it as the first key. Not all drawings need to be keys or breakdowns. Try acting out the motion before animating it. You don't need complete drawings.<br>
	Focus: timing, spacing, gesture drawing, volume control, putting principles of animation together.<br>
<br>
